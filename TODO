Things to do

Short term
- Reading part
    - Get reading book popup to work at all -> probably can't find data because it isn't public, try moving into the static folder
    - Get the reading part to be cards with Image and Title -> maybe some shadow hover stuff to show clickable
    - Sub nav like searchable museum or side nav like other sites (left column). For jumping to fiction read, fiction unread, learning read, learning unread
    - Get the reading part to create a new page when clicked on that shows title, image, my thoughts, and my review
- Get Personal Projects part to work and be dynamic in nature
- Some drop downs that don't suck lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-VeYcOCFZw&t=3s
- Some refinement of what I'm trying to do in certain sections (perhaps a scaling back of scope at least until I get to a good beta stage so I can update my resume accordingly)
- Update Resume and LinkedIn and site Resume to include Fearlesses current work

- Basically also can do tik tok integration where I have a bunch of pages that are auto generated based on a template and an array of tik tok urls, then you can scroll through somehow?


- Make site responsive and good on mobile
- Maybe a QR code to link to my site that I can attach to my resume? That would be kinda neat. 



Long term
- Blog internally?
- Somehow link legacy site inside of new site (without them being 2 seperate things?)
- Add some cute little fade in transitions -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jauXV4oHqU&t=2s
