Things to do

Short term
- Get reading book popup to work at all -> probably can't find data because it isn't public, try moving into the static folder
- Get Personal Projects part to work and be dynamic in nature
- Some drop downs that don't suck lol 
- Some refinement of what I'm trying to do in certain sections (perhaps a scaling back of scope at least until I get to a good beta stage so I can update my resume accordingly)
- Update Resume and LinkedIn and site Resume to include Fearlesses current work



Long term
- Make site responsive and good on mobile
- Blog internally?
- Somehow link legacy site inside of new site (without them being 2 seperate things?)
